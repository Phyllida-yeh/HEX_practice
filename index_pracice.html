    <p>Swedish police have arrested a teenager after a fatal triple shooting in the city of Uppsala on Tuesday. 
    The shooter reportedly fled on a scooter following the attack in 
        <a href ="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4n9x3yyq5o" target="_blank">a hair salon in the centre of the city,</a>
    triggering a manhunt.Police confirmed on Wednesday that the person arrested for the shooting is under the age of 18.
    All three victims were aged between 15 and 20 years old, Swedish police told a news conference, though the region's chief of police Erik Åkerlund said their identities have not been "100%" confirmed.

    <p>Police are investigating the possibility the deaths are related to gang crime, Swedish media reported.
    One of those murdered at the hair salon is reportedly known to the police, local media said.
    The victim was involved in a police investigation over a planned attack against a relative of gang leader Ismail Abdo, according to the reports. The person was never charged.
    Abdo, nicknamed 'jordgubben' or 'the strawberry', is a well-known gang leader.

    <p>A new, violent chapter in Sweden's gang wars began when 
        <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1e85l701y3o" target="_blank"> Abdo's mother was murdered in 2023 at her home in Uppsala, north of Stockholm.</a>
    Sweden has seen a wave of teenage gang crime in recent years, with suspects accused of a range of offences from vandalism to murder.
    The Swedish government has proposed new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children under the age of 15 in an attempt to grapple with the problem.
    In a pre-planned press conference on gang violence on Wednesday, the Minister of Justice Gunnar Strömmer suggested police would not need concrete evidence to conduct the wiretaps.
